<h1>Human Ethics</h1>

<p>Mount Royal University maintains a Human  Research Ethics Board (HREB) that is compliant with the Tri-Council Policy  Statement (TCPS) on human research ethics.&nbsp;  You can find out more about the TCPS at <a href="http://pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/">http://pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/</a>.</p>
<p>Mount Royal's HREB</p>
<ul>
  <li>reviews  all human behavioural research activities that either originate at MRU and/or  that take place at MRU</li>
  <li>is <b>not</b> certified to review research studies that fall under the Health Information Act (HIA), that is, studies that either access or create patient records. These studies may be reviewed by CHREB at the University of Calgary (see below)</li>
<li>does  not review biomedical studies that involve biomedical treatments or interventions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the general ethics review process at MRU</p>
<ul>
  <li>you  need to secure ethics clearance for your study before you begin to recruit and/or  gather data from your participants</li>
  <li>clearance  generally takes between 4 and 6 weeks, depending on the complexity and risk  inherent in your study</li>
  <li>once  you have ethics clearance, you also need to seek further clearance from HREB if  you wish to make any changes to your processes, procedures or documents, during  the study</li>
  <li>you  must also follow all appropriate legislation, procedures, laws and policies  that apply to your study from granting bodies, the institution and/or  provincial or federal governments</li>
  <li>HREB  accepts ethics applications at any time (but does not process them during  June-Aug)</li>
  <li>HREB  works with you to secure ethics clearance for your study</li>
  <li>To  help facilitate a relatively speedy review, it is very important that you submit  your application well before you want/need it cleared (at least 4 weeks  beforehand) and that you hand in an application that is clear, concise and comprehensive</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Human Research Ethics Review Process</h3>
<p>To help you prepare for and navigate through  the ethics review process, we have prepared a guide that you should read.&nbsp; This guide covers more than just the ethics  review as it also includes academic integrity and risk management issues.&nbsp; It shows you how the human research ethics  review fits into the overall &ldquo;research ethics&rdquo; process at MRU.&nbsp; Follow the path through the document that  matches your specific needs.</p>

<h3>The Human Research Ethics Application</h3>
<p>Once you have read through the process and are  ready to submit an ethics application (if that is what you should do), download the application below.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please  note that this document is interactive i.e. depending on the choices you make  new questions may pop up.&nbsp; As well, there  is contextual help in most sections.&nbsp;  Please read the contextual help if it applies to you, and send us  feedback (to <a href="mailto:hreb@mtroyal.ca">hreb@mtroyal.ca</a>) on whether you found it helpful and/or  whether other information would also be of help.&nbsp; If you have any questions at all, do not  hesitate to contact either Glynis McCance (403-440-6069) in the Office of  Research Services or the current Chair of the HREB.&nbsp; They would be happy to assist you.&nbsp; The other members of the HREB can also be  approached for assistance.

To ensure your application is reviewed prior to June 15, you must submit it by <b>May 9.</b> Please ensure that all attachments are included (don't forget your methodology document).  Applications that are not thoroughly completed will be returned. Any remaining applications may have to wait until mid-August.</p>
