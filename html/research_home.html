			<p>Research or creative practise are critical components of the post-secondary experience. Most of our faculty at Mount Royal are active researchers, 
            with projects ranging from multi-institutional grant-funded 'big science' to small individual projects. What ties them all 
            together is the link between research and the classroom. 
            
            
            
            Faculty are not only encouraged, but are expected, to bring their research into the 
            classroom. Whether that translates into teaching research techniques, demonstrating cutting-edge work, or directly involving undergraduates in
            their projects, faculty work to link these two sides of their jobs.</p>
