  (Science and Engineering Research Canada) is the national instrument for making
  strategic investments in Canada's capability in science and technology. NSERC
  supports both basic university research through research grants and project
  research through partnerships of universities with industry, as well as the
  advanced training of highly qualified people in both areas.<br>
  <br>
  NSERC "Discovery Grants" are the backbone of Canadian natural science/engineering
  researchers. NSERC has a New Faculty category that makes it a little easier
  to achieve success on your first grant application. Otherwise, you are judged
  on your track record (number and significance of publications) and the proposal
  you put forth.<br>
  <br>
  <a class="side" href="http://www.nserc.ca/">NSERC's website</a> is quite detailed
  and contains all the information you'll need to apply. Below is a synopsis
  of the major types of grants TRU faculty typically focus on. </p>
<h5>Discovery Grants (formerly Standard Grants)</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Supports on-going programs of research
  <li>Typically awarded for 5 years (new)
  <li>No 'memory' &#8211; you can work on research other than what you proposed,
	so long as you publish at an appropriate level

  Social Sciences and Humanities
  <hr>
</h4>
<p>SSHRC &#8211; The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council &#8211; focuses
  on funding innovative thinking about real life issues, including the economy,
  education, health care, the environment, immigration, globalization, language,
  ethics, peace, security, human rights, law, poverty, mass communication, politics,
  literature, addiction, pop culture, sexuality, religion, Aboriginal rights,
the past, our future.<br>
  <br>
  SSHRC supports a range of funding initiatives. The most important for individual
  faculty is their Standard Research Grants(SRG) program. These are investigator-driven
  grants that run up to three years. The idea is to establish a research program,
  with research projects embedded within. You can then look to a series of
  grants to cover your long-range work. If you continue to publish at an appropriate
  rate (and quality), SSHRC committees will look kindly on renewing your funding
for the next 3 years.</p>
<p>Researchers may apply for a SRG either as a &lsquo;New Scholar&rsquo; or as
  a &lsquo;Regular Scholar.&rsquo;
  The distinction is made in order to allow new scholars to benefit from a more
  flexible
  evaluation of the two main components of an application, the project proposal
  and the
  researcher&rsquo;s curriculum vitae (CV). &lsquo;Regular Scholars&rsquo; applications&rsquo; are
  evaluated based
  on a 40% merit of research proposal and 60% CV. New scholars are evaluated
  on the<br>
  best outcome of a 40-60 or 60-40 evaluation.
  An applicant is considered a &lsquo;New Scholar&rsquo; if at least one of the
following applies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Completed highest degree within the five
	years preceding the date of the<br>
  application submission;</li>
  <li>Held a tenure-track position for
  less than five years;</li>
  <li>Career interruption or delay for family
  reasons (such as maternity leave);</li>
  <li>First-time PI on a SSHRC
	  grant<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5 >Standard Research Grants</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Supports programs of research - new or on-going
  <li>&quot;To support investigator-chosen research in the social sciences and
	humanities conducted by individuals or teams&quot;<br>

  Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) is Canada's major federal funding agency
  for health research. Its objective is to "excel, according to internationally
  accepted standards of scientific excellence, in the creation of new knowledge
  and its translation into improved health for Canadians, more effective health
  services and products and a strengthened Canadian health care system".</p>
<p>CIHR invests in four "pillars" of health research, including biomedical; clinical
  science; health systems and services; and the social, cultural and other factors
  that affect the health of populations. </p>
<p>The CIHR framework includes <a class="side" href="#" onClick="alert('Institute of Aboriginal Peoples\' Health \rInstitute of Aging \rInstitute of Cancer Research \rInstitute of Circulatory and Respiratory Health \rInstitute of Gender and Health \rInstitute of Genetics \rInstitute of Health Services and Policy Research \rInstitute of Human Development, Child and Youth Health \rInstitute of Infection and Immunity \rInstitute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis \rInstitute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction \rInstitute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes \rInstitute of Population and Public Health\r\r\r\r');return false;">13 "virtual" institutes</a>,
  each one dedicated to a specific area of focus, linking and supporting researchers

<p><b>Delegates:</b> The CIHR operates a little differently from the other granting
  councils. They have a 'University Delegate' program. CIHR keeps them informed
  of directions, initiatives and decisions, and solicit their active participation
  on awareness activities. Through them, the CIHR is informed of the views of
  the community on research opportunities and concerns expressed on CIHR business.<b> Our
  delegate is Susan Duncan (Dean - Nursing)</b>. The ORS has copies of all communiques
  and delegate meeting minutes.

<h4><hr>Canada Foundation for Innovation<hr></h4>
<p><img src="images/cfi1.gif" alt="" width="80" height="49" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="1" align="right">The
  CFI currently funds many of the 'big ticket' projects in Canada. Since 1997 they
  have approved over 2300 projects representing almost $2 billion. The key word
  is 'Innovation'. CFI funds infrastructure, not actual research. By creating state-of-the-art
  infrastructure they want to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>transform the way research is done;
  <li>create a strong and vibrant research environment across Canada;
  <li>attract and retain excellent researchers;
  <li>enhance research productivity and the training of highly qualified people;
  <li>build new national and international networks and partnerships
</ul>
<p>TRU is eligible for CFI Innovation funding, though smaller universities generally
  have a tougher time attracting these large grants. To be successful, you must
  show that your infrastructure will generate world-class research, that it is
  unique in Canada, and that you have a team that can carry out the work. Competition
  for CFI funds has become much stiffer in recent years. However, many smaller
  institutions have been successful by finding a particular niche and exploiting
  local strengths. <br>
  <br>
  A particularly unexploited funding source for TRU is the Leaders Opportunity Fund - designed to help universities attract and retain the very best of today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s researchers at a time of intense international competition. <b>There is
  no competition for these funds - you simply must prove that you deserve them.</b><br>
  <br>
  CFI funds only 40% of a project. The remainder typically comes from a mix of
  provincial government and other sources, usually split 40:40:20.</p>
<h5 >Leaders Opportunity Fund</h5>
<ul>
  <P>A university may put forward a proposal for a current faculty member who holds a full-time academic appointment, or for an identified candidate whom the university is in the process of recruiting to a full-time academic appointment. Universities are expected to submit LOF proposals to attract or retain faculty in priority areas as identified in their Strategic Research Plan.
  <P>Candidates must be recognized leaders in their field of research, or show promise of becoming research leaders. They must be engaged in, or embarking on, an innovative research program for which the infrastructure is essential and which will provide an enriched research training environment.</P>

<h5 >Infrastructure Operating Fund</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The Infrastructure Operating Fund (IOF) is a result of a CFI announcement
	in October 2000 of the addition of $400M to the total CFI budget, specifically
	to fund operating costs of certain awards made after July 1, 2001. The fund
	will be made up of 30% of the total finalized CFI contribution to the capital
	costs of successful Innovation and New Opportunities applications.
