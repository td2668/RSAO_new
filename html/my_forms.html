<h2>The Research Tracking Form</h2>

<p>
The MRU Research Tracking form is designed to provide the Office of Research Services with information we need to efficiently administer your research funds and to maintain our institutional legal and ethical obligations. If you wish to submit an application for research funding, you must first complete a Research Tracking Form.
</p>
<p>Some departments require the submission of a Research Tracking Form for all research projects, funded or un-funded. For details, please contact your Dean.

    <h3>Updates - Sept 2013</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Electronic Approvals</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Tracking Form system has now been updated so that Dean approvals can be completed electronically.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you submit a tracking form, your Dean will automatically be notified, and when your Dean has
                approved, the Research Office will be notified. At each stage you will receive an email so that you are
                aware of the outcome.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Ethics Tracking</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When you indicate on your tracking form that your research requires REB approval, the Ethics Officer will
                be notified, and will link your REB application to your tracking form. This will allow you to log in to
                RSOnline and easily track the status of your ethics certifications, including expiry/renewal dates.
            </li>
            <li>
                *NOTE: All REB applications, even those for research that is not associated with funding, will require  that
                you complete a Research Tracking Form.
            </li>
