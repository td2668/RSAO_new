        <h1>Looking for Grad School Funding?</h1>

        <p> Many Mount Royal students are going on to grad school either in Alberta or elsewhere. One of the key
            questions asked by these students is about funding: what's available, what you need to do to apply and when
            should you apply?
            Depending on whether you are applying to Master or doctoral level grad school there are a range of
            possibilities available to fund your grad school study. Funding opportunities are available at federal,
            provincial and the university you are planning to study at.
            To find funding, the Alberta Learning Information Service (ALIS) is a good place to start:
            <a href='http://alis.alberta.ca/ps/gs/funding.html'>http://alis.alberta.ca/ps/gs/funding.html</a>
        </p>

        <h2>When should I apply?</h2>

        <p> It is the norm to apply for a grad scholarship in the final year of you undergrad study if you are intending
            to go straight onto grad study. If you are looking to take a break from your studies, apply in the
            competition immediately preceding your grad school start date. Remember, though, that the application
            processes may change if you are a Mount Royal graduate as opposed to a current Mount Royal student.
        </p>

        <h2>Federal Funding: SSHRC, NSERC and CIHR</h2>

        <p> Most grad schools encourage incoming students to apply to the graduate scholarships offered by one of the
            three federal research funding agencies:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>SSHRC - covers the Social Sciences and Humanities</li>
            <li>NSERC - covers the Natural Sciences and Engineering</li>
            <li>CIHR - covers Health related fields</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each of the three agencies has funding available at the Master's and doctoral level.</p>

        <h3>SSHRC, NSERC and CIHR Canada Graduate Scholarships (CGS) Master's Level</h3>

        <p> Essential information: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Value: $17,500 (with NSERC this can vary by programme).</li>
            <li>You can only apply to one of SSHRC, NSERC and CIHR per year.</li>
            <li>For current Mount Royal students, follow the application processes outlined below.</li>
            <li>You generally do not have to have been accepted onto a grad school programme in order to apply for these
                awards.
            </li>
            <li>You normally have to be applying for a full-time grad programme in order to be eligible.</li>
            <li>To be eligible, the grad school programme you are applying for has to include significant research
                training and
                be research based.
            </li>
            <li>You should be a permanent resident or Canadian citizen.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How to apply</h4>

        <p> Each of the three funding agencies have different application processes and different application deadline
            dates. The application processes vary between whether you apply through Mount Royal or directly to the
            funding agency concerned.
        </p>
        <ul> <li>CIHR: current Mount Royal students should apply straight to CIHR (application deadline: February 1).</li>
             <li>NSERC: current Mount Royal students apply through Mount Royal (Mount Royal's internal deadline: November
             1).</li>
            <li>SSHRC: current Mount Royal students apply direct to SSHRC (application deadline: December 13).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>General Tips:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> All the applications involve using the funding agencies' online application systems, so it is a good
                 idea to get going on your application as soon as possible.
            </li>
            <li>All the three federal funding agencies require transcripts as part of their application processes, so
                don't leave it until the last minute to get hold of your transcripts from the Registrar's Office. Note:
                only up to date and official transcripts should be part of your CGS application.
            </li>
            <li> You normally will need two referees who complete part of the application. Again, make sure that you
                 have contacted your referees in plenty of time and they know what to expect and when.
            </li>
            <li>Follow the instructions given exactly. These are not just suggestions, the instructions are exactly how
                the funding agency wants their application, so do as they ask.
            </li>
            <li>Write your application for an educated, general audience. Ask yourself whether a student or professor in
                another faculty would understand your application.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        <h4>For Psychology Students :</h4>

        Make sure that you apply for the correct funder for your proposed course and research.
        While all three of the federal agencies fund psychology, they fund different aspects of psychology and you can
        only apply to one agency.</p>

        <h2> Other Funding Available
        </h2>

        <p>The Alberta Learning Information Service (ALIS) has some good information on other scholarships offered in
           Alberta: <a href='http://alis.alberta.ca/ps/gs/funding.html'>http://alis.alberta.ca/ps/gs/funding.html</a>
        </p>
    <br/>
        <p> Most universities offer a range of graduate scholarships, which are usually awarded through the Faculty of
            Graduate Studies. You should be able to find information about what scholarships are available at your
            chosen
            grad school on the Faculty of Graduate Studies' website. If not, ask! Similarly, university departments with
            graduate courses often have graduate scholarships available. If you can't find any information on the
            department's website, then contact their Graduate co-ordinator or administrator. It is a good idea to
            contact
            them in any case to ask where current and previous students have received funding.</p>
        <h4> Other ideas:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If you (or your parents) are a member of any national or provincial organizations, check to see if the
                organizations have any scholarships available (e.g. Scouts, Rotary Club, Lions, Girl Guides,
                professional
                organizations, even employers).
            </li>
            <li>Once at grad school look out for research assistant employment opportunities coming up.</li>
            <li> Talk to people you know who have been to grad school and ask them how they funded their studies.
            </li>
            <li>If you are really are in financial difficulty once at grad school, most universities offer some sort of
                financial aid programme.
            </li>
        </ul>
