<p class="hbhead"><h3>3.0 Types of Funding</h3></p>
<p class='hb'>Faculty projects are funded through two principal avenues - <strong>grants</strong> and <strong>contracts</strong>.
  Different policies and procedures apply to each, so it is important to draw
  a clear distinction between the two.<a name="1"></a></p>
<h5>Grants</h5>
<p class='hb'>A Research Grant is financial support for an investigator (or investigators)
  conducting research in a particular subject area or field, usually with the
  flexibility to pursue new research interests, provided they are within the
  mandate of the funding agency. A grant has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The research project is designed and controlled by or under the direction
	of the faculty member;</li>
  <li>The research project involves no proprietary data protected by the funding
	agency or any other agency under any contractual commitment to the funding
	agency;</li>
  <li>Any patents, inventions, copyrights or other intellectual property belong
	to the University and not to the funding agency;</li>
  <li>No direct or indirect reimbursement to the faculty member (except for certain
	grants from U.S. sources);</li>
  <li>The funding agency may not restrict publication of the research findings
	by any approval or delay process;</li>
  <li>Grant funds are not linked to achieving specific milestones;</li>
  <li>Grant funds are made available before, not after, expenditures (though
	this may take place in periodic installments);</li>
  <li>Capital equipment that is purchased with grant funds belongs to the University
	and not to the funding agency.<a name="2"></a></li>
</ul>
<h5>Contracts</h5>
<p class='hb'>A Research Contract is an agreement between two corporate bodies (namely,
  the sponsor and the University) whereby the sponsor provides financial support
  for research in a particular subject area or field under specific stipulations
  and conditions. Contracts usually support a research project.</p>
<p class='hb'> All contractual agreements referred to in this document are related to research
  activities. Contracts may include the following types of agreements:</p>

	<td><ul>
		<li>Affiliation;</li>
		<li>Confidentiality;</li>
		<li>Consulting;</li>

		<li>License;</li>
	</ul></td>
	<td><ul>
		<li>Materials Transfer;</li>
		<li>Service/Testing and Analysis;</li>
		<li>Sponsored Research;</li>
		<li>Use of Space, Facilities or Equipment.</li>
	</ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class='hb'>A Research contract typically possesses many of the following characteristics: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The research project is defined by specific stipulations and conditions
	detailed in the contract, as agreed upon by all parties involved;</li>
  <li>A set time schedule for the work to be done;</li>
  <li>Defined deliverables and due dates;</li>
  <li>Established ownership, patent rights and licensing arrangements;</li>
  <li>Provisions for confidentiality of information supplied and created by the<br>
	agreement;</li>
  <li>Established budget approvals and payment schedules;</li>
  <li>Established considerations for acceptance and/or termination of<br>
	agreement;</li>
  <li>Limited liability of participants, indemnity;</li>
  <li>Any other matters that may be appropriate to the circumstances.<a name="3"></a></li>
</ul>
<h5>Contribution Agreement</h5>
<p class='hb'>A Contribution Agreement lies somewhere between a grant and a contract. Here,
  the university agrees to make a defined in-kind or other contribution that
  will complement the sponsor's financial support. The sponsor may be a federal
  granting agency, for which the agreement has many aspects of a grant. It may
  also be a private agency, in which the agreement has many aspects of Contract
  Research. Unlike grants, payment of the financial contribution seldom precedes
  the conduct of research and invoicing is usually necessary to receive payment.
  Deliverables are frequently expected.</p>
