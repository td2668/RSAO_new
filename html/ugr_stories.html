Program: Psychology<br>
Year: 4<br>

<p>The majority of my work was performed independently but my researcher / faculty member was always available via email and we had the occasional meeting to check on progress and address any concerns that may have emerged from my responsibilities. I believe we formed a positive relationship and everything ran smoothly. I was able to set my own schedule and deadlines for this project so it helped me develop more self-discipline. I don?t yet know if this will influence my future career path but for the time being, it?s great to be able to add it to my resume.</p>

<p>I learned how to approach issues specific to my degree with multiple ideas and solutions. I really gained a lot of confidence in my skill set, and developed new skills that I would not have been exposed to (I believe) had I not had this opportunity. I feel that I have gained a lot of insight into various career paths, and excellent exposure to other professionals in the industry because of my research position.</p>
