<h1>What Is Research?</h1>

<h3>Present Your Research</h3>

<p>Students are able to present their research through a number of different oral and written submissions. </p>

<p>One of the most popular forms of presenting a research initiative is through visuals, such as posters that are displayed around campus. Essays, papers and reports are other examples of written ways to present your research. </p>

<p>Presenting your research orally comes at forums and conferences. In the past, Mount Royal has had students present their research at conferences both locally and across the country.</p> 


 
<h3>Why Get Involved in Research? </h3>

<p>When you think of research, what's the first thing that comes to mind? </p>

<p>For many, its science and the discovery of hard, concrete facts but in reality, it involves subjects that span across language and culture, the humanities, arts and social sciences, and many more. </p>

<p>One of the greatest things about research is its diversity -- it gives you the opportunity to further your education by contributing to something that you're passionate about. You have the ability to learn something new, whether it relates to academics or discovering something new about yourself. </p>

<p>The opportunities available at MRU are no different in offering students chances to embark on research across a variety of fields. Whether it involves investigating ways to revive rural economies in Alberta or digging through the National Archives in Ottawa, Mount Royal has a number of opportunities to ensure students from all faculties can be involved in research.   </p>

<h3>How Do I Get Involved?</h3>

<p>The first thing you need to do as a student looking to get involved in research is decide what interests you and then pursue it. Talk to people from different departments: professors, teaching assistants and even peers that have previous experience in undergraduate research.</p>

<p>Before applying for any research opportunities, make sure you have an up-to-date resume and show enthusiasm throughout the application process.</p>
