        <p>This page allows you to transfer your authority to another person, who will then be able to approve tracking forms or annual reports during a Dean's absence.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>After you have transferred authority, the current Dean will no longer be able to approve tracking forms or annual reports.  <b>The delegate will need to login and assign authority back to the Dean when appropriate using this page.</b>  Alternatively, you can contact the Research Office. </p>
