	<p>Everyone knows that Charles Darwin transformed our sense of what it means to be human by showing that we evolved from non-human ancestors. But most don't realize how far-reaching his ideas are. Much of modern dating and mating behaviour — from pick-up lines in a singles bar to long-term mate selection — can be shown to be the result of unconscious drives shaped by tens of thousands of years of evolution.</p>

Prior to joining Discovery, Jay hosted CBC radio’s national science show, Quirks and Quarks, from 1979 to 1992.
