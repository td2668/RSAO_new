<h5 class="staticsubhead">First Steps After Receiving a Grant (external, generic)</h5>
<p><strong>Notification:</strong> Most federal granting agencies notify the ORS
  about your success (or lack thereof) before notifying you. Once you have the
  news, the details will typically arrive by mail within 2-4 weeks. If you were
  denied, you will receive comments from the committees that will hopefully enable
  you to be more successful on reapplication. With over-subscribed agencies such
  as the CIHR this first-time-denial, fix, reapply scenario is considered quite
  typical.</p>
<p><strong>Account Setup:</strong> A Notice of Award (and soon after a cheque)
  will arrive in the ORS and in the Finance office at about the same time as
  the details (or be delayed until the granting period begins). Finance will
  then contact you about setting up a grant account. </p>
<p><strong>Ethical Approval:</strong> If you require ethical approval for your
  work, this must have already occurred, or your grant funds will be held until
  approval is verified.</p>
<p><strong>Budget:</strong> Finance will require that you submit a budget to
  them, using <a href="../documents/funding/codes.html">standardized budget codes</a>.
  Your yearly financial statements to the granting council will be based on these
  budget divisions, so if you are working with a finicky council or a grant with
  fixed categorical expenditures, make sure you code your expenses properly.</p>
<h5 class="staticsubhead">First Steps (internal or institutional grant such as
  SIG)</h5>
<p><strong>Notification:</strong> You will first be notified of success/failure
  by the ORS or by the committee responsible for the grant (typically the Scholarly
  Activities Committee). </p>
<p><strong>Ethical Approval:</strong> As with external grants, you will be required
  to obtain a certificate of approval from the appropriate Ethics Committee if
  your work involves human or animal subjects (or falls within the parameters
  of 'requiring ethical approval' as defined in the <a href="policies.php?section=ED-15-2">TRU
  Policy ED-15-2</a> Section 2) before your funds can be released. Note: It is
  your responsibility to flag this requirement and to seek and obtain approval.
  TRU has signed an agreement that makes all federal funds dependent on our performing
  appropriate ethical reviews of all relevant research. If you don't flag such
  research you put everyone else's funding at risk.</p>
<p><strong>Account Setup - SAC Grants</strong>: Your grant will receive a unique
  grant number that should be used in all requests and correspondence. You currently
  will not be granted access to your account via FAST (TRU web-based account
  management), as SAC accounts are held in a different database. Questions regarding
  balances and spending authorizations should be addressed to the Research Finance
  Officer, who is specifically responsible for these accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Account Setup - Other Institutional Grants</strong>: These are individual
  or group grants awarded to the institution and (typically) distributed by SAC
  using grant-specific criteria. These grants function in a similar manner to
  standard external grants, except that TRU is responsible for reminders, reporting,
  renewals, etc. </p>
<h5 class="staticsubhead">Spending (all grants)<a name="2"></a></h5>
<p><strong>What You Can/Can't Sign For</strong>: You have signing authority on
  the grant account assigned to you. If it is an external grant the account is
  in your department's business unit. Any expenditures above $1000 (or whatever
  limit your Chair/Dean authorizes when the account is set up) require a Chair/Dean's
  signature. Purchases of Capital Items (assets over $1000) will also go the
  the VP Finance for approval. Also, any cash expenditures, reimbursements, or
  travel advances/claims require a Chair/Dean's signature. <br>
  Institutional grants (i.e. those distributed by TRU) fall into the Research
  Office's business unit. The Research Coordinator (Grants Officer) in the ORS
  can sign for large, cash, or travel expenditures.</p>
<p><strong>Buying Things</strong>: Items &lt; $100 can be purchased for cash
  and reimbursed with a petty cash form (must be signed, then you take it to
  the cashier in Finance). You can also use a Purchase
  Requisition</a>. A PR must be used for items over $100. This is the only form
  you will need. If you are buying from another department (this includes the
  Bookstore) you use an <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/docs/idi.pdf">Interdepartmental
  Invoice</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Travel:</strong> No matter what the source of the grant funds your
  travel expenditures must abide by TRU travel policy. See the <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/travelhandbook.html">Finance
  travel pages</a>, and note the <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/pro_manual/ap_travel_automile.html">flat
  rates</a> for travel using your automobile to certain common destinations.
  Travel advances require signatures on a <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/docs/traveladv.pdf">Travel
  Advance Form</a> as noted above, and if your final cost is &gt; 110% of your
  estimate a further signature is required when you submit your <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/docs/travelexp.pdf">Expense
  Report</a> or your <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/docs/travelexpinreg.pdf">Within
  Region Expense Report</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Contracts</strong>: TRU uses a standard Professional Services Agreement
  (<a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/docs/psa1st.pdf">p1</a> and <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/docs/psa2nd.pdf">p2</a>),
  which must be filled out in addition to any contracts between you and a contractor.
  These require several signatures and take a bit of time to set up. However,
  they streamline multiple invoice payments. Just quote the PSA number on all
  invoices. Read <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/pro_manual/contract_index.html">this
  synopsis</a> and contact Gloria Rowe at 5604 for more details. </p>
<p><strong>Hiring</strong>: If you hire research assistants or others you are
  required to work through the Human Resources office and to abide by all Faculty
  Association and CUPE agreements. This typically requires some time and effort,
  and will take you up into the &gt;$20/hr range including benefits.<br>
  Consider alternatives before taking the step of hiring through HR. Is this
  a student learning situation? If you plan your project around students learning
  while researching rather than using hired researchers, you can take advantage
  of scholarships such as the CUEF. See the ORS for details. <br>
  There are also arrangements in place to allow the hiring of post-doctoral researchers
  at standard post-doc rates. <br>
  Also consider hiring your research expertise by contracting an external agency. </p>
<p>Note: before taking any of the above steps, do ensure that you are aware of
  the proper definition of 'Research Learning' or the <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/pro_manual/research_hirasst.html">restrictions</a> on
  who comprises a valid 'contractor'.</p>
