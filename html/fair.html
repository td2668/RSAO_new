   <h2>Faculty Profile</h2><br />
											   
   <p>The VIU 'Scholarly Activity Report' is being transitioned into a faculty profiling tool. While the information will still be available to list faculty activity and achievements as a whole, the primary purpose is now to allow you to profile yourself in a variety of ways. </p>
   
  <p> <b>Teaching</b> Courses taught, teaching interests, teaching profile</p>
  
  <p> <b>Scholarship</b> The original scholarly activity report categories -- papers, conferences, etc.</p>
  
  <p> <b>Community Engagement</b> Teaching, scholarship and service often engage with the external community. Here you can detail the community part of activities from any category 

So in the main list we list independent entries from all categories, in the order chosen by the user
But if they click on a category to view it specifically we showcase
