<h5>CUEF Scholarships</h5>
<p class='hb'>The CUEF is a unique opportunity to directly fund undergraduate student research in <strong>any</strong> field. The focus is on student research learning, not on the faculty project (of course, one facilitates the other). There is a maximum of $5,000 available for each Student Research Scholarship. Although there is no stipulation of 'one per faculty member', the need to distribute funds across disciplines means that it is unlikely that a faculty member would host two CUEF students at the same time.</p>
<p class='hb'>Up to 20 of these scholarships are distributed per year, with two intake periods: </p>
<ol>
  <li>September call, mid-October deadline for Fall/Winter semester</li>
  <li>February call, mid-March due date for Summer semester </li>
</ol>
<p class='hb'>The application comes from the student, but is developed in close consultation with a faculty supervisor. This could be driven either way: a student with an interesting project idea may approach a potential supervisor; or a faculty member with a project might locate a suitable, interested student. The project should be of suitable length to fit within a (max) 12 weeks period, and must result in specific learning outcomes. If the research work is a portion of a larger project you must ensure that it stands alone to some degree.</p>
<p class='hb'>Steps Involved:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Identify your student / identify your supervisor;</li>
  <li>Develop a project proposal. It must focus on student learning outcomes. (500 words) </li>
  <li>Complete ethical review if required;</li>
  <li>Complete a budget (80% or more must go to the student directly);</li>
  <li>Faculty member completes a course outline. For the duration of the scholarship the student is registered in a research-learning course.</li>
  <li>Faculty member completes an RESL Course Approval form. </li>
  <li>Faculty member writes a recommendation; student submits a transcript; </li>
  <li>Chair and Dean sign, and all documentation is submitted to Research Services. </li>
</ol>
