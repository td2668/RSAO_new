<h1>Biomedical and Health Information Studies</h1>


Any biomedical studies involving human participants or human health information cannot be reviewed locally, as only five boards in the province are legally able to perform such reviews. MRU has signed an MOU with the UofC's health board (CHREB) that allows our researchers to access their services. Any such applications MUST go through the MRU Office of Research Services, as we are responsible for monitoring and other follow-up. The ORS will initiate the process at your request, after which you will follow the CHREB's application process using their forms.
