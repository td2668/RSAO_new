   <h2>Indirect Costs Program</h2><br />
											   <br />
Mount Royal receives an annual allocation from the Federal Indirect Costs of Research Program. It is a percentage of the floating 3-year average of the funding received from the three granting councils: NSERC, SSHRC and CIHR. The funds are used to partially offset financial and research compliance salaries, thereby freeing up the base funding needed for: The Faculty Conference Travel Fund, time release for the Ethics Board Chair, PD for the Ethics Board and ORS staff, and it helps us maintain Internal Grants at a fairly constant level despite multiple years of budget cuts. <br />
