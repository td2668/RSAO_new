             <h3>Faculty Conference Fund</h3>
            <dl>
            The Faculty Conference Fund provides resources for faculty to attend conferences. Funding levels depend upon the amount of overhead brought in during a particular year into the Office of Research Services budget. Since we can't carry funds over year end, we can't always commit to funding this program until later in the academic year.<p>
            In 13/14 there is a total of $15,000 available. Application deadlines are December 12, 2013 and May 1, 2014. Normally we can't fund conferences that take place before your application comes in, but because there was no fall intake we will accept applications for conferences taking place Nov. 21, 2013 on in the December intake only.
