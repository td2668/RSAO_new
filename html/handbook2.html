<p class="hbhead"><h3>2.0 The Grant Process at MRU</h3> </p>
<p class='hb'></p>
<p class='hb'>Research Services processes all external grant applications
  for MRU. The signature of the Director of the ORS is the &quot;University Authorized
  Signature&quot; for TRU, and is required on all external applications. The
  ORS is also available to review your application, however the following schedule
  must be adhered to.<br>
	<br>

<p class='hb'>Although we will make every effort, the ORS cannot guarantee that an application
  will be sent on time if submitted less than 2 days prior to the agency deadline.
  This is due to workload scheduling, the need to verify RTS requests, etc. </p>
<p class='hb'>Note that 'Agency Deadline' must be back-timed to include any transport
  delays (where the grant is due <strong>at the agency</strong> on the deadline).
  Most couriers do not guarantee overnight to Ottawa from Kamloops, so 2 days
  should be allowed. <a name="1"></a></p>
<h5>Steps in the Submission Process </h5>
<ol>
  <li>Contact the ORS Director via email during grant development to discuss
	requirements and issues specific to the type of grant; </li>
  <li>The researcher fills out an ORS Grant Form online. This form requires the
	digital signature of yourself and your Dean, and should be completed well
	in advance of the ORS deadline. The agency form may also require physical
	signatures. </li>
  <li>Deliver the completed application, with all required signatures, to the
	ORS. The preferred method is to send/drop the signature pages and deliver
	the remainder via email (agency PDFs AND your source documents to permit
	in-line commenting). <br>
	Physical delivery can either be directly to the Director's office (House
	6/7 - Research Administration) or to the reception desk in the Advanced Technology
	Centre (Trades 155 - staffed 8:30 - 4:30). </li>
  <li>The grant is reviewed as follows (or as requested, time permitting):<br>
	  <p class='hb'> <strong>Basic Check</strong>: Status of all faculty verified; RTS or
		other university contribution verified.</p>
	  <p class='hb'><strong>Administrative Review</strong>: Above + Check on all budget
		items for consistency and adherence to policy; Review of 'Research Summary'
		and other non-technical sections for readability by general audience.</p>
	  <p class='hb'><strong>Full Review</strong>: Above + Full reading and analysis of budget
		justification; Detailed comments on non-technical sections. </p>
  </li>
  <li>The researcher is contacted via email with suggestions and comments.</li>
  <li>Corrections/additions are applied by the researcher and the full number
	of required documents are brought to the ORS. If any changes that affect
	the signature page (e.g. budget total changes) then new signatures are required
	from your Dean and or Chair.
	  <p class='hb'> <strong>Digital-only Submissions</strong> (e.g. NSERC): All of the
		above deadlines remain in effect. However, 'delivery' is via web submission.
		Do NOT depend on the agency to inform the ORS of your submission. Send
		an email.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The application is assembled and signed by the Director of the ORS. The
	Director's signature is the &quot;Authorized University Signature&quot; and
	acts as the Presidential Designate signature when one is required. This signature
	has different meanings for each agency, but typically indicates that the
	applicant is a faculty member at the institution and that the institution
	guarantees any listed contributions.</li>
  <li>The application is couriered to the agency before the deadline date. </li>
</ol>
