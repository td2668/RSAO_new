<h1>Undergraduate Research &amp; Scholarship</h1>
<p>Research isn't just something you do in lab coats -- it is done in virtually every discipline. And even though topics can be vastly different from one another, they all have one thing in common: the research expands human understanding and is the cornerstone of education. It might entail the discovery of new facts or principles, but it also might mean developing a new way of applying knowledge, or developing a better understanding of how people learn.</p>
<p>Research projects can be vastly different from one another. They might involve hundreds of people, or just one; they might be well-funded or operating on a shoe-string; you might work in exotic locales or simply on a blackboard. The one thing for sure is that the possibilities are endless. </p>

<p>At VIU, undergraduate research is about getting our students involved in the creation and discovery of knowledge. We strive to provide our students with opportunities and experiences that contribute to and facilitate learning in a multitude of disciplines. </p>

<p>We encourage students to ask questions and push the boundaries of their knowledge, as well as the way they think about things. We want to ensure they feel their research has taken them on a journey of discovery and contributed to knowledge development. </p>


<p>Other abilities that students will develop include: </p>
