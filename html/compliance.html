<h1>Compliance</h1>
<p>Mount  Royal University believes in maintaining high ethical standards when it comes to research and scholarly activities.&nbsp; If you are an MRU researcher or if you are someone that wishes to conduct research  here at MRU, you need to secure proper clearance for your research.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Step 1:</dt> 
<dd><i>Mandatory for all activity</i> Complete a Tracking and Signature Form. This is required for all activities, funded or unfunded -- even none of the following steps are necessary. MRU must maintain records of all research activities and whether they do or do not require specific clearances from ethics, biosafety, etc.</dd>
<dt>Step 2:</dt>
<dd><i>Mandatory for all activity</i> Complete a Conflict of Interest declaration. If you have no conflicts, you'll just be ticking 'none'. </dd>
<dt>Step 3:</dt>
<dd>If you have animal or human subjects, complete the appropriate application.</dd>
<dt>Step 4:</dt>
 <dd>If your research involves biohazards, complete the appropriate application.</dd></dl>
<p>If you require any of the latter compliance steps you'll have to limit your activities until the applications are appropved, so start early.
