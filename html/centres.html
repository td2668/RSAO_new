        <p class="staticsubhead">Institute for Environmental Sustainability - IES</p>

        <p>The mission of the Institute for Environmental Sustainability (IES) is to improve environmental health and
            sustainability through scholarship that integrates diverse academic disciplines, student learning and
            community engagement. The IES will achieve this mission by facilitating research and scholarly collaboration
            on environmental sustainability across the Mount Royal University Campus and with connections to partners
            from industry, government and other research institutions.</p>

        <p>Most of the world's most pressing issues are predicated on sustaining a resilient environment. Addressing
            these challenges requires the creation of new knowledge and methodologies that integrate ecological, social,
            and economic factors. The IES is comprised of an interdisciplinary group of principal investigators working
            on basic and applied problems in environmental sustainability. The IES will is a forum where faculty,
            students and other stakeholders will come together to build knowledge and develop viable solutions that will
            contribute to the overall welfare and security of society. The Institute will strengthen, coordinate and
            facilitate collaborative research and other scholarly, artistic and academic activities which are not
            undertaken within Mount Royal's departmental structure. The emphasis of the IES is to initiate and
            coordinate collaborative, interdisciplinary research and scholarship with input from faculty, students and
            the community.</p>

        <p class="staticsubhead">Institute for Nonprofit Studies - INS</p>

        <p>
            Over 2 million Canadians work in the nonprofit sector, arguably the most dynamic, challenging and rewarding
            facet of our nation's economy-and one that is growing at an exceptional rate.</p>

        <p>Recognizing the increasingly important role that the nonprofit sector plays in Canada's economy and social
           structure, Mount Royal University launched Canada's first Institute for Nonprofit Studies (INS). The
           Institute, launched in 2000, combines education and research tailored to meet the rapidly changing needs of
           the nonprofit sector.</p>

        <p>An initial donation of $1 million from an anonymous donor provided start-up funding for the Institute and
           helped set its Canada-wide agenda. Immediately following the launch of the Institute, a new, four-year
           Bachelor of Applied Nonprofit Studies degree - also a national first - was created. The first class of
           students graduated in the spring of 2005. Starting in September 2009, A nonprofit specialization will be
           available within the Bachelor of Applied Business studies.</p>

        <p>In January, 2009, the Charter for the Institute for Nonprofit Studies was officially approved for a five year
           term.</p>

        <p>The Institute for Nonprofit Studies Institute works in close collaboration with the nonprofit community,
           business and other post-secondary institutions to ensure that what is undertaken is focused on the needs of
           the nonprofit sector. To achieve this, an advisory committee composed of members of the nonprofit community,
           businesses, foundations, post-secondary institutions, and Mount Royal faculty was created to help guide the
           Institute and its initiatives.</p>

        <a name="innovation"></a>
        <p class="staticsubhead">The Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</p>

        <p>Our goal is simple: to create and foster an entrepreneurial mindset. We want to graduate students with a
           mindset marked by imagination, a readiness to take on new projects, and perseverance to overcome all
           obstacles.</p>

        <p>Students that develop entrepreneurial minds are innovators that transform small and large companies, drive
           social enterprise, create new ventures and build dynamic communities.</p>

        <p>At the core of being innovative and entrepreneurial are a student’s ambitions and individuality. Our students
           get to customize their entire experience to fit around the things that make them unique. Our students can
           marry their personal passions and entrepreneurial skills to impact the world, satisfy their ambition to start
           a new venture, or uncover their true passions to chart a fulfilling career. The experience our students gain
           as innovators set them far apart from their colleagues and peers. Students that experience innovation and
           entrepreneurship at Mount Royal gain qualities that are on everyone’s must-hire list.</p>

        <p class="staticsubhead">Institute for Scholarship of Teaching and Learning</p>

        <p>This institute has a mandate to encourage and support faculty from all areas in the study
           of teaching and learning. Their research will, in turn, enhance student learning and inform teaching practice
           at Mount Royal.</p>

        <p>The Institute represents an important piece of the institutional infrastructure needed to support faculty
           engagement in scholarship related to teaching and learning. The Institute will support individual faculty
           members pursuing research projects relevant to their students and discipline, but in addition, the Institute
           will support and encourage interdisciplinary scholarship of teaching and learning projects on questions of
           interest to faculty members across the institution.
