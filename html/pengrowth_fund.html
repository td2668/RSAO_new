            The Pengrowth Undergraduate Presentation Fund is designed to help Mount Royal University students to prepare
            for their futures and develop their leadership skills by presenting original scholarly work at academic conferences.
            Awards from this fund are intended to fund travel to conferences for full time Mount Royal University students. In
            order to be eligible, students must be presenting their own scholarly work (e.g. a presentation, poster,
            demonstration, visual arts piece or performance) at a regional, national or
            international scholarly meeting or conference.

        <h2>Grant Amounts</h2>

        <p>
            The Pengrowth Undergraduate Presentation Fund provides funding of up to $800 for regional provincial student travel,
            $1500 for national travel, and up to $2000 per student for international travel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Travel expenses will be reimbursed upon the submission of original receipts for eligible travel/conference
            expenses.
        </p>

        <h2>Eligible Expenses</h2>


        <ul>
            <li>Airfare</li>
            <li>Conference Registration</li>
            <li>Accomodation</li>
            <li>Meals</li>
            <li>Ground Transportation</li>
            <li>Other (check with Research Office before incurring expenses on this fund)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Funds</h2>
        <p>
            This fund is designed to provide a resource when other funds are not available. If other funds are available for your
            travel, the Pengrowth Undergraduate Presentation Fund must only be used when those funds have been
            exhausted. Please include, in your application, a description of any other funds that have been identified and why
            they are not available, or, if partial funds are available, please describe those funds and their source, and
            detail expenses that the Pengrowth fund is required to cover.
        </p>

        <h2>Adjudication</h2>

        <p>
            Grant applications will be assessed by the Office of Research Services. It can be expected that applicants will be
            notified within 3 weeks of receipt of application in the Office of Research Services. Please note that application
            package must be received in the Office of Research Services before the conference date, and that funding is not
            guaranteed.
        </p>

        <h2>Availability of Funds</h2>
        <p>
            The Pengrowth Undergraduate Presentation Fund is a one-time fund of $25,000. Once all funds have been
            exhausted, the program will have been completed.
        </p>

        <h2>Funding Priorities</h2>

        <p>
            The Pengrowth Undergraduate Presentation Fund is designed to support students in high-impact research
            presentation activities. While we value and wish to acknowledge all student involvement in research, due to
            limitations on funds available, they will be awarded to projects based on the following priorities:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Impact of the Event</b><br/>
            Priority will be given based on the impact of the conference. High-profile conferences that are well
            recognized in the academic community will be prioritized over smaller events with a more regional impact.</li>

            <li><b>Impact of Presentation</b><br/>
            Presentation of peer reviewed papers will have priority over non-peer reviewed. Presentations will be
            given priority over posters, which will be given priority over abstracts.</li>

            <li><b>Level of student involvement</b><br/>
                Where work is collaborative (with, for example, a supervisor), presentation of material where the student
            is the lead author and the student is the primary presenter will be prioritized over presentations where
            the student is secondary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Eligibility</h2>

        <p>
            To be eligible for this fund, applicants must:

            venue that takes place after the application package has been received by the Office of Research Services. A
            funding decision can be expected approximately 3 weeks after the application deadline.</li>
            <li>The research for this presentation must have been completed while you were a student at Mount Royal
            University.</li>
            <li>Each student is eligible to receive Pengrowth Undergraduate Presentation funding once.</li>
            <li>You may apply for this award even when your acceptance to a conference is still pending.</li>
        </ul>
