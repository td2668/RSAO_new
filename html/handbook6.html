<p class="hbhead"><h3>6.0 Preparing a CV</h3></p>
<p class='hb' >Granting agencies vary in the type of CV they require. However,
  almost all have a their own specific type of form that forces you to enter
  each element yet again. However, as these are usually online, the form is there
  waiting for your next application. </p>
<p class='hb' >The following are hints that relate to most of the  federal
  agency CVs.  </p>
<p class='hb' ><strong>NSERC</strong> limits your list of publications and contributions to the
  past 6 years only. However, an equally important part of the CV is the description
  of your &quot;Five Most Significant Contributions&quot;. These can extend beyond the
  6 year limit. Some faculty choose to treat a specific paper as one contribution,
  listing and then elaborating on it. Others provide a one or two paragraph description
  of a specific area of contribution, and then list the publications that resulted.
  Remember - you do not have to list all five.</p>
<p class='hb' >The <strong>Delays in Research Activity</strong> section is intended
  to allow you to explain any obvious gaps in your record, such as primary caregiver
  for an infant, or a period of time in administration. Be very careful discussing
  your heavy teaching load here. I usually recommend that you not make an overt
  statement, as it could backfire (&quot;why should we give her a grant if she has
  so little time?&quot;). Focus on positive statements (e.g., &quot;although I had a full-time
  administrative load in 01-02 I continued to publish in...&quot;) </p>
<p class='hb' >The <strong>Training of HQP</strong> section is very important.
  The lack of significant access to graduate students is a major problem with
  our institution (from an Ottawa point of view) that must be addressed. Reiterate
  your access to an undergraduate student base that is regularly involved in
  research activities. If you can, note that previous undergraduate involvement
  led to an increased number of graduate school applications. </p>
<p class='hb' >Note: <u>You do not need to include a Form 100 Appendix B</u> (Eligibility
  Questionnaire), as you are considered tenured/tenure-track faculty. </p>
<p class='hb' ><strong>SSHRC</strong> CVs are quite similar to the above, with some slight differences
  in time periods covered.</p>
<p class='hb' ><strong>CIHR</strong> CVs are perhaps the most onerous. They use
  the (somewhat inaptly named) &quot;Common CV&quot; system, found at <a href="http://www.commoncv.net">http://www.commoncv.net</a>.
  There is less room for leeway than in the other agency forms, and most faculty
  find that the forms take some time to complete.</p>
