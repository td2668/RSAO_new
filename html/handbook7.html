<p class="hbhead"><h3>7.0 Preparing a Budget</h3></p>
<p class='hb'>The key to preparing a budget is to show that all expenses are
  required for the
  research project, and therefore, are justified accordingly. Most granting agencies
  use
  zero-base budgeting for the calculation of the money they will award. Expenses
  that
  are not sufficiently justified may be excluded in the awarded grant, or can
  even lead to<br>
  the rejection of the application. Most application forms include both a budget
  grid and
pages for the description of the specific individual budget items, with justification. </p>
<p class='hb'>  Each funding agency has specific regulations for eligible and
  ineligible expenses. Applicants are encouraged to carefully read the
  regulations of the granting
  agency for the granting program prior to completing any proposal. In general,
  the
  following items are covered: salaries for research assistants and/or technicians,
  materials and supplies, dissemination, travel, and, in some instances, minor
  equipment
  purchases.</p>
<p class='hb'> A few important notes to keep in mind when preparing a budget:</p>
<h5 class='hb'>General Approach<a name="1"></a></h5>
<p class='hb'>Focus on the time period that the granting agency does (5 years
  for NSERC, 3 for SSHRC standard grants...) and wrap your research and funding
  around this time. For example, for NSERC funding I might plan 2 years of data
  gathering, 1 of analysis, and 2 more for writing and dissemination, allowing
  sufficient time for papers to get into print before the next application window
  (at 4.5 yrs). </p>
<p class='hb'>Think through everything that might be needed, even if some items
  might change later. It is better to look like you have a solid plan than to
  give the impression that you'll 'wing it' after year 2. Most agencies allow
  you to make significant alterations in your plans and purchases once the award
  has been granted. </p>
<h5 class='hb'>Student Involvement and Hiring Others<a name="2"></a> </h5>
<p class='hb'>Granting agencies want to see their money going to students. If
  you do not hire students for a task you should justify why this is required.
  It is in your interest to maximize the number of students hired, rather than
  hiring one for the duration (though this may not be in the student's best interest
  - so a balance is usually struck). </p>
<p class='hb'>At present, all hiring through TRU must fall under the categories
  and procedures established in the CUPE Agreement (students) or the Faculty
Agreement (lab assistants, post-docs, research associates, etc.). The general
  categories are:</p>
<p class='hb'><strong>Undergraduate Students</strong>: A funded grant can be
  used to pay students that will be learning while they are assisting you in
  your research. It is important to distinguish between this and a true 'student
  research assistant', who is simply given a task to do. The latter requires
  that you hire under the CUPE 'RA' category, with pay rates in the $18-$21/hr
  range. This level of pay is considerably in excess of that typically paid to
  undergraduates, and so should not be part of your grant budgeting. (Don't
  forget about benefits - budget an additional 20%) </p>
<p class='hb'>If the student will be learning while assisting they can be provided
  with an award from your funds, and the rate for this award can be set to fall
  within the typical amount expected in a grant application. An example rate
  is the NSERC Undergraduate Awards (available if you hold an NSERC grant). Here,
  the rate for 3 months of full time research assistantship by a student is $5400
  (about $85/day).</p>
<p class='hb'>Also - look into the CUEF program for undergraduates. Here a TRU
  fund pays for the student at a rate similar to the NSERC one above. However,
  as this is a competitive program you cannot use it in your grant budget. However,
  the program should be noted in your justification (e.g., TRU utilizes internal
  funds for undergraduate assistantships, awarded on a competitive basis. I will
  be applying for 1 assistant in each of the three years of my grant, thereby
providing an additional 3 students research learning opportunities.</p>
<p class='hb'><strong>Non-Student Help</strong>: Anyone not currently an undergraduate student
  who is hired for their expertise using grant funds falls under the heading
  of 'Research Associate'. This is a faculty agreement position that permits
  you to hire at faculty support rates, or a rate mandated by an external agency,
  for a specific period. Talk to the ORS for more details. </p>
<p><strong>Postdocs</strong>: A Letter of Agreement allows post-doc pay at current granting council
  rates.</p>
<h5>Purchases<a name="3"></a></h5>
<ul>
  <li>Each item in the budget should be justified through reference to a research
	activity. </li>
  <li>Wherever possible, provide an indication that you have researched the cost
	of an item or activity and have made an effort to choose the lowest cost
	alternative.</li>
  <li>Where it is obvious that some element/item would be necessary for your
	research but is not mentioned in the budget, note how you will obtain/access
	it (e.g., provided by university; sharing with other researcher...) </li>
  <li>In the case of equipment purchases, some agencies will
	require at least two
different quotations for the requested configurations (especially in the case
of equipment costing more than $25,000 per item).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Overhead<a name="4"></a></h5>
<p> Overhead is a charge levied to provide some compensation to the university
  to meet operating and capital costs. All researchers are required to request
  the maximum overhead allowable on all research grants and contracts. If no
  rate is specified, the nominal rate is 15%. Please contact Research
  Services for specific information on other applicable rates. NSERC, CIHR and
SSHRC operating and equipment grants do not permit overheads. </p>
<h5>GST<a name="5"></a></h5>
<p> Grant and contract proposals must include the GST where appropriate. Almost
  every service, piece of equipment or supply that you buy or rent from non-University
  sources will attract the GST. This includes travel, accommodation and meals.
  It is up to the researcher to ensure that sufficient funds have been requested
  from the funding agency to cover the GST. The University is not required to
charge GST when contracting out its services or those of its faculty members. </p>
<h5>Dissemination and Travel<a name="6"></a> </h5>
<ul>
  <li>Dissemination costs do not normally exceed 10% of the
	  overall research
	budget, unless the grant program is specifically intended for dissemination
  activities.</li>
  <li>Travel expenses also vary depending upon the nature of the
		research, and
	allowable costs generally include transportation, lodging and per diems
	for
  subsistence (at TRU rates). The rates are listed in the <a href="http://www.tru.ca/finance/travelhandbook.html">Finance Travel Handbook</a> </li>
</ul>
<h5>Sample Budget<a name="7"></a></h5>
<p>The following is an outline of a budget and corresponding justification documentation
   required by most granting agencies. Please keep in mind that each granting
	agency has
different requirements.</p>
<p> The ORS has a bank of successful applications from various
  granting
  agencies and for many programs available for researchers to consult. These
  samples
  include proposals, budgets and budget justifications and can be accessed by
  all faculty.</p>
