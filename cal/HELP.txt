================================================================


1) I DON'T HAVE A DATABASE, WHAT DO I DO FIRST?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need MySQL installed, I leave that to you.  Google will help you with that.

Once installed, you can log in with the database username and password.  On linux, your root account will usually have the ability to log in as well.  To login, type this at the command prompt:

prompt> mysql -u yourUserName -p

This will log in with username "yourUserName"

Once in, you can create a database with the sql command below

create database theDatabaseName;

That command will create a database with the name "theDatabaseName".

After creating the database, it will not have any tables yet - start the installation instructiosn above at this point.


2) HOW DO I RUN SQL CODE?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
New to SQL eh?  SQL code is really a large let of commands that need to be given to the mysql database, the code will not run on the command line or anything like that.  To run it, you will need to either use myphpadmin, or some other MySQL administration software, to run a SQL statement and copy the text from the install.sql file into the field for the commands it will run.

You can also do it from the command prompt like so:

prompt> mysql -u myuser name -p databasename < install.sql

(note you should use update.sql if updating)

That line will use the username "myuser" and the database "databasename" when creating the tables (the tables are created by "myuser" and are put inside the "databasename" database)
 

3) WHAT DO I DO IF I CAN'T LOG INTO THE CALENDAR AFTER IT'S INSTALLED??
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure you are using the default password specified in the config.php file, and that 
the username you are using is "root" (without the quotes).


4) I LOST MY ROOT PASSWORD, HOW CAN I RESET IT?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The root password is saved in the options table under the name "root_password".  You can 
remove that row from the table, and it will then change back to the default.  Having the 
value in the options table literally overrides the default in the code. 
The default password is set in the config.php file and is changable.
