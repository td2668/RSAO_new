<h4>When and Why</h4>

<p>A tracking form is a mandatory part of engaging in any research activity at Mount Royal. Although it is <u>your</u> research, that fact that you are doing it at MRU provides you with many benefits: insurance on your activities and those you hire, the ability to apply for funds, full financial management, and a range of other services out of the ORS and ADC. However, we need your activity on record to ensure that these are possible.</p>
<p>A tracking form is intended to capture, and keep up to date, some basic information about your activity. You fill out a new one if you are:</p>
<ul><li>Starting a new project.</li>
<li>Applying for funds.</li>
<li>Bidding on or entering into a research-related contract</li>

</ul>
<p>If you have already put one on file for the project you can modify it in the case of:</p>
<ul><li>Personnel changes</li>
<li>New conflicts of interest to declare</li>
<li>New or changed commitments</li>
<li>Budget changes or application success</li>
</ul>
<p>All information in the document is considered confidential to the extent allowed by FOIP and Federal legislation.</p>
