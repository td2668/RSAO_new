<h4>Ethics Review</h4>

<p>If your poster or presentation presents research that has involved data gathering from human subjects, then you (or your supervisor or class) must have clearance from VIU's Research Ethics Board, as required by federal agencies and VIU policy. If you have any questions about this please talk to your supervisor, instructor, or our ethics specialist, Lars Apland (lars.apland@viu.ca)</p>
