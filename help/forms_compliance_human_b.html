<h4>Human Subjects - Behavioural</h4>
<p>(See the <a href='/documents/policy/585-1_ethics.pdf' target='policy'>MRU Policy</a>) Research Involving Human Participants (behavioural) is defined as an undertaking intended to extend the collective knowledge of a field through a disciplinary inquiry or systematic investigation,
which involves living individuals, is non-clincial in nature, and does not involve any invasive procedures.  These types of studies include studies involving the conduct of interviews, administration of questionnaires, tests, observations and experimental manipulations in the humanities, behavioural and social sciences.</p>
