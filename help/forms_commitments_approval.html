<h4>Dean Approval</h4>

<p>Commitments noted on this page will add an extra step to your form approval, as Dean approval is required. For the Internal Grants Fund the approval is handled behind the scenes, after you submit. For paper-based and external applications you'll need to send the PDF to your Dean (along with the actual grant/contract form) once you've completed and pressed 'submit'.</p>
