<h4>Principal Investigator</h4>

<p>The PI or Principal Investigator on a project is the personal nominally in charge. If it is a shared project then there will have to be just one person responsible for administrative details such as these forms. No matter how you set this, as the initiator of the tracking form it (the form) will still belong to you.</p>
