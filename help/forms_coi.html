<h4>COI Forms</h4>
<p>A Conflict of Interest form is a required part of the tracking form, and at least one (for the PI) must be on file for every project.</p>
<p>Even if you have <u>nothing</u> to declare, you'll need to tick that box.</p>
<p>Any MRU researcher on your team will be able to create one of these forms from their login. If you have a team member or a student who requires a form but does not have an account, you can create additional forms with this button. Just add their name in place of yours.</p>
