<h4>What is CREATE?</h4>

<p>CREATE is an annual showcase of student scholarship, research and creative activity. It is set up similar to an academic conference, with posters, verbal presentations, and plenty of opportunities for other students, faculty and the public to discuss projects with the student leads. It is NOT about faculty research, though student projects are often components of faculty work. The focus is student achievements. </p>
<p>Although most project work happens in senior years and in Masters programs, students at all stages of their education are encouraged to participate. If you have created something you are proud of, then bring it along.</p>
