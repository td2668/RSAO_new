<h4>COI - Evaluation - Academic Work</h4>
<p>For example, you might be requested to act as a referee on a paper that is in direct competition with work you are doing yourself. You might be asked to evaluate a grant proposal that you could not be objective about. Refusing the request is not always posible, but properly declaring and managing the conflict may be an alternative.</p>
