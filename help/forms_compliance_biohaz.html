<h4>Biohazards</h4>
<p>MRU's Biosafety Program helps manage the risks associated with biological hazards in order to provide faculty, students and researchers access to pathogens requiring up to Level 2 containment while ensuring that the University and surrounding communities are protected. The Biosafety Policy (currently in draft) and the associated guidelines, procedures and training together form the Biosafety Program.</p>
