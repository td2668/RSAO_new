<h4>COI - Acceptance</h4>
<p>If you are receiving anything, including equipment or in-kind gifts, from a funder or contractor, you would declare that here. Outright gifts are normally discouraged, but in specific cases (such as when working with different cultural norms) they are acceptable within limits. The focus here is the size/amount beyond which an observer might think that the gift could influence the research.</p>
